/* O-Ring v1.3 Copyleft © ALL WRONGS RESERVED © Gray (https://graycot.com/).

O-Ring takes inspiration from OnionRing (https://garlic.garden/onionring/onionring-widget.js). While much of the O-Ring code is original, specific portions of the OnionRing script have been re-arranged and repurposed. 
Unlike OnionRing which was designed to be a JavaScript widget on each webring member site, O-Ring was built as a redirect script hosted by the webring RingMaster. This eliminates the security vulnerability of remote
JavaScript on each webring member's sites. Additionally, the HTML method is more flexible and allows each member more creative freedom on the look and functionality of the ring code on their site.
